Greetings, I'm Nitin, a Junior at Mumbai University, learning Computer Engineering, while also navigating the complexities of DevOps & help others by making tutorial videos & technical blogs.

In charting my course for the future, I lean towards the ethos of an officer and a gentleman on a personal mission, aiming to discover the depths of my own potential and knowledge.

Apart from work, I like to learn about different cultures, their traditions & native folk stories. I love travelling solo & blend in as a local! Keeps my Dopamine high & feel like spy.

When I'm not tinkering with gadgets, I'm your classic thinker, trying to learn, adapt & lead. No grand mission statements hereâ€”just a guy trying to live to its fullest.
