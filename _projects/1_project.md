## Project Description: 

TerraTowns is a community website that acts as a hub to discover and connect terraformers to each other's self-hosted personal websites in the style of Geocities of 2023.
Terraformers will write the infrastructure as Code (IaC) to launch their Terra House.
A Terra House is a simple Content Management System (CMS) that will allow you to author your own personal website and connect it to the TerraTowns network.
